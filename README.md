# Spring Cloud Contract Demonstration Project - Producer

This repository is a Spring Boot application that serves an API.

A consumer for this API can be found [here](https://github.com/ospector/jj2017-scc-consumer).

It is part of a demonstration on the use of Spring Cloud Contract as a framework for developing and testing APIs.

The code advances in steps, each of them tagged. You switch between them by executing `./stage.sh #`, e.g. `./stage.sh 0` will give you the intial source code without SCC.

As you advance each stage adds code (the commit comment explains what).

The full presentation was made at Jamin' Java 2017, Israel.

The slide deck can be found [on slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/omrispector/coordinating-microservices-spring-cloud-contract)
